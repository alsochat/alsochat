- 👋 Hi, I’m @alsochat
- 👀 I’m interested in learning/practising python/django coding.I found lot of fun in doing that...
- 🌱 Recently I found a interesting place: 'workplace' in RunCode. I’m trying to build a project/app on RunCode's abuntu Linux terminal, but I met a problem of 'that port is already in use' or '127.0.0.1:8000 refuse to connect' while I try to 'runserver' 
- 💞️ I’m looking around here try to figure out a solution for the problem so that I can go on with my app. 
- !!!! hope someone here who know what's going on and can drop a line to light me up...
- Salute! Cheer!!
